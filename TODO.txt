All stuff that needs to be done should be listed here. Highest priority items first, and stuff from the future last.


Most Important:
-Decide on map format.
-Decide on 3d-model format.



Relevant stuff:
-Get some sample texture set for walls and floors and balls.
-Get some sample models for buildings.
-Display cursor in game, make UI widgets (buttons, labesl, textboxes, etc.)


Minor stuff:
-Figure out a good way to switch resolutions
-Make a main menu (learn text rendering. See lwjgl slick util tutorial).
//Counterpoint: TWL does this and more! We are saved!
-Counter counterpoint: We need a new UI theme. Do not want grey. Maybe use the other standard TWG theme?




Future features:
-Destructible environments
