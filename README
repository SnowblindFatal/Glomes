Glomes is (was?) a project made by J. Saarela and J. Konttinen. It is a sketch of a game engine and includes 3d graphics, balls and their collisions, loading levels from a text file and some other features. The physics operate on 2d. A demo of the engine can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMamNqJ3-XU


Currently requires the following libraries:

LWJGL 
-LightWeight Java Game Library.
